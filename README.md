# NBAShootingAnalysis

This will be using data sourced from https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-r-nba-shooting-data which is orignally soured from https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting?Season=2022-23&SeasonType=Playoffs&PerMode=Totals

This particular data set only focuses on 4 players.

This will attempt to compare their distribution of shots, accuracy of various shots ( corner 3's, midrange, close range etc.), and defensive capabilities. 

This will require some creative ways to count shots in the midrange, or a complicated inexing of the dataframe.

https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/NBA-Court-Dimensions-.png from the offical NBA website will be used for the dimensions of the court and what consitutes 3 points, midrange, and close range.
