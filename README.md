# NBAShootingAnalysis

This will be using data sourced from https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-r-nba-shooting-data which is orignally soured from https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting?Season=2022-23&SeasonType=Playoffs&PerMode=Totals

This particular data set only focuses on 4 players.

This will attempt to compare their distribution of shots, accuracy of various shots ( corner 3's, midrange, close range etc.), and defensive capabilities.
